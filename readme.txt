Please download both programs to be able to run Chebyshev Colloaction method to solve 
Diffusion partial differential equation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
The present Python code calculates the effect of the diffusion on the state of charge (Z) in a li-ion 
   battery in an sphere as a particle where Z is a function of distance and time Z= f(x,t).
   The governing equation, a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) has to be solved which is written as:
   
   PDE:
      Td*dZ/dt = d2Z/dx2  where d2Z/dx2 is the second partial derivative in terms of the distance x from center
   Boundary conditions:   
      dZ/dx at center = 0
      dZ/dx at surface = surface flux
   
   An approximate method of discretization, Chebyshev Collocation Method is used to simplify the solution. 
   Program starts after the number of collocation points (N_collocation) is set (default value is 6). 
   
   Based on an inventory arrangement of the problem and matrix operations, the Backward-Euler method 
   can be applied to calculate vector Z(t).
   
   Current profile, time, and boundary conditiones are updated in a Class named: Time_Current_Boundary
   if needed dt can be set as well
   
   Please note: 
   1. The first Derivative matrix (D) is already multiplied to 2 in the code. Therefore, ther is no need
      to apply number 4 at the discrete 
   form in the square of D (D2). Therefore, the discrete equation will be:
   Td* dZ/dt= D2*Z 
   where Td is the known diffusion time constant.
   2. Other methods based on ODEINT in python are not stable while calculating with different time steps
      or the number of collocation points
   3. Current limitation has been applied to prevent Z exceeding the permitted area (0<Z<1)
